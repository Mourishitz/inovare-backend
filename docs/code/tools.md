# Tools

This project is based on a Golang stack, using some of its tools for easy development.

## All tools:
- Gorm -> ORM library for Golang
- Gin -> HTTP web framework
- Air -> Live reload for Go apps
- Atlas -> Migration tool for databases 
- Docker -> Containerization platform


## Why these tools?
- **Gorm**: It simplifies database interactions by providing an easy-to-use ORM layer,
  allowing developers to work with databases using Go structs and methods instead of raw SQL queries.
- **Gin**: It is a high-performance web framework that offers a simple and fast way to build web applications and APIs in Go, with features like routing, middleware support, and JSON handling.
- **Air**: It enhances the development experience by automatically reloading the application whenever code changes
  are detected, reducing the need for manual restarts and speeding up the development process.
- **Atlas**: It provides a robust way to manage database schema migrations, ensuring that database
  changes are versioned and can be applied consistently across different environments.
- **Docker**: It allows for easy containerization of applications, ensuring that they run consistently
consistently across different environments by packaging the application and its dependencies into a single container.
