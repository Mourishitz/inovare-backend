# How to read

This docs modular, which means that anything related to how the system works (or should work) is inside the `./domain` folder.

If you are a developer, or just want to know more about the codebase, then read the `./code` folder. Inside of it it will have everything that is code related (for example: tools that are being used, design patterns and how the system was developed).

Feel free to add or contribute to those resources if needed.

Thank you, and enjoy the reading :)
